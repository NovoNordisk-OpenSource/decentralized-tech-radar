Test Guide


Note!
Download the latest release from https://github.com/Agile-Arch-Angels/decentralized-tech-radar_dev and 
the w.txt file from https://github.com/JonasSkjodt/specFile . Insert the w.txt file in your tech radar folder


Phase 1: Fetch specification file(s)


1. Open Command Prompt


2. Open the program by inserting one of the following commands
Note: use the command appropriate to your operating system


For mac:
./Tech_Radar-darwin fetch https://github.com/JonasSkjodt/specFile main w.txt
	

For windows:
.\Tech_Radar-windows fetch https://github.com/JonasSkjodt/specFile main w.txt
	

Note: to fetch, this is how we write it in the command prompt:
./Tech_Radar fetch <git-url> <branch> <path/to/whitelistfile>


git-url being any valid public git repository


branch being any valid branch name for the given repository


path/to/whitelistfile being a path to a locally stored whitelist file, see more in fetcher_usage.md


Anything being encased within <> is obligatory to write with the command




3. Inspect and see if you have fetched the specification files in your cached folder
Note: find the cached folder in your downloaded tech radar folder
Phase 2: Merge csv files


4. Click into the Command Prompt again


5. Insert the following CLI command to merge (and thereby validate) the specification file


For mac:
./Tech_Radar-mac merge ./cache/specfile.csv ./cache/specfile2.csv
	

For windows:
.\Tech_Radar-windows merge .\cache\specfile.csv .\cache\specfile2.csv
	

Note: To merge, this is how we write it in the command prompt: 
./Tech_Radar merge <path/to/csvfile> <path/to/csvfile2> [path/to/csvfile3] …


path/to/csvfile being a path to a locally stored csvfile with correct format


        Anything enclosed within [ ] is optional to write.




6. Inspect your Tech Radar folder to find the merged file

For windows: 
.\Tech_Radar-windows generate .\Merged_file.csv
	

9. Inspect your Tech Radar folder to find the index.html file
