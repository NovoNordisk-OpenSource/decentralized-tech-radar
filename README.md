# Decentralized Tech Radar

IT University of Copenhagen, ISE 2024 Collaboration

> CREDIT: The tech radar generation code is based on the ThoughtWorks Build-Your-Own-Radar repository. [You can find the open-source repository here](https://github.com/thoughtworks/build-your-own-radar?tab=AGPL-3.0-1-ov-file#readme). All credit for the JavaScript and CSS parts of this project goes to them

> IMPORTANT: This repository is meant to house a toolstack for generating a tech radar from configuration/specification files. It does _NOT_ contain a company specific tech radar.
